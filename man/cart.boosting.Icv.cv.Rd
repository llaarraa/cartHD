\usage{
  cart.boosting.Icv.cv(my.data.train, y,
    my.weights = rep(1/nrow(my.data.train), nrow(my.data.train)),
    my.prior = NULL, min.samples = 3, min.gain = 0.01,
    max.depth = 5, nfolds = 5, num.boost = 10,
    nfolds.Icv = 5, check.data = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{my.data.train}{training set data; samples by rows,
  variables by columns}

  \item{y}{vector with class membership: must be 1 or 0 and
  its length must be equal to the number of samples (number
  of rows of my.data.train)}

  \item{my.weights}{weights for each observation, vector
  with length equal to the number of observations; the
  default is equal weights to all the observations}

  \item{my.prior}{vector containing the prior probability
  for class 1 and class 0; if NULL it is set equal to the
  empirical prior (weighted frequencies of the classes)}

  \item{min.samples}{minimum number of samples in a node;
  if the number of samples is lower or equal the algorithm
  stops splitting}

  \item{min.gain}{minimum improvement in the Gini index
  (calculated for FUTURE observations, the calculation
  includes the prior information, similarly as in rpart)}

  \item{max.depth}{maximum number of levels of the tree}

  \item{nfolds}{number of folds to be used for
  cross-validation}

  \item{num.boost}{number of boosting iterations}

  \item{nfolds.Icv}{number of folds to be used for internal
  cross-validation (within boosting for the assessment of
  predictive accuracy)}

  \item{check.data}{logical indicator, if set to TRUE the
  function checks the formal correctness of the objects
  passed as arguments to the function. Set to FALSE to save
  computational time - for example when running
  simulations.}

  \item{verbose}{logical indicator, if TRUE the progress of
  the computations is printed out in the console}
}
\value{
  list with the cross-validated predictions on training
  data and additional information (see below)
  \item{prediction.cv}{cross-validated class predictions
  for training samples obtained using boosting}
  \item{class.train}{true class membreship for training set
  samples} \item{score.cv.class1}{cross-validated scores
  assigned to each training sample, evaluated using
  boosting - samples with positive scores are classified in
  Class 1.} \item{accuracy.cv.all}{overall cross-validated
  predictive accuracy}
  \item{accuracy.cv.class1}{cross-validated predictive
  accuracy for class 1}
  \item{accuracy.cv.class0}{cross-validated predictive
  accuracy for class 0}
}
